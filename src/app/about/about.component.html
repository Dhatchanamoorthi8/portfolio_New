            </h1>
            <p class="rtl:text-right mb-3 text-gray-500 text-left dark:text-gray-400"> I am a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in
                JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, and Node.js. Over
                the past year, I have honed my skills in building dynamic web applications and managing databases with
                Sequelize. My
                experience includes developing RESTful APIs and creating efficient solutions for both frontend and
                backend
                development.

                One of my notable projects is an RFID-based attendance management and document tracking system. In this
                project, I
                designed and implemented a full-stack application that enables real-time tracking of attendance and
                documents,
                streamlining administrative processes for organizations. By integrating RFID technology, I ensured
                precise,
                automated data collection, contributing to improved operational efficiency.

                I'm dedicated to delivering high-quality software solutions and continuously expanding my technical
                knowledge to
                meet evolving industry demands.
